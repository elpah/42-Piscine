- Weâ€™re dealing with a program here; you should therefore have a function main in your .c file.
- Create a program that displays its given arguments.
- One per line, in the same order as in the command line.
- It should display all arguments, except for argv[0].
- Example:

    ```c
    %> ./a.out test1 test2 test3 | cat -e
       test1
       test2
       test3
    %>
